    "text=(\"Python is becoming the go-to tool for data scientist across all industries. This beginner-level workshop is aimed at those with no experience in programming or data analysis, but who want to get started with this powerful, easy-to-learn language. You will participate in hands-on activities, such as plotting basic graphs, and will become familiar with essential terms and concepts used in computing and data science.You will need to install Python to be able to participate in this workshop. We'll send you an e-mail with instructions after you register, if you'd like to try to install it prior to coming to the event, but we'll also walk through the installation process as part of the workshop. Before you come, please be sure you have the correct administrator rights on your laptop to allow you to do this.\")"
